    <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The internet has many systems and services, providing convenience and advancement in several domains. 
        However, this advancement comes with security challenges, particularly in detecting and preventing network 
        intrusions. Modern networks face increasingly sophisticated attacks that traditional security measures struggle 
        to detect effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) addresses these challenges by employing a hybrid approach that 
        combines machine learning techniques with hardware acceleration using PYNQ-Z1 FPGA. This integration enables 
        real-time detection of malicious network activities with higher accuracy and lower latency than software-only solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        This document outlines the architecture, implementation details, and performance metrics of our NIDS system, focusing 
        particularly on the integration of FPGA hardware acceleration for enhanced performance.

    <h2 id="background">2. Background</h2>
    <p>
        In this section, we delve into the challenges faced by modern NIDS and how our approach helps overcome these limitations.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Challenges of NIDS</h3>
    <p>
        Network Intrusion Detection Systems encounter various challenges that are often overlooked yet significantly 
        impact their effectiveness:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="bold">Accuracy:</span> Based on some levels of accuracy, it does not mean that one can rely on existing 
            detection systems. This is why our approach leverages reinforcement learning to continuously improve detection accuracy.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="bold">Diversity:</span> More than before, there has been a rise in the number of new or customized 
            protocols in modern networks. Our system adapts to this diversity through comprehensive feature extraction and pattern analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="bold">Dynamics:</span> Because of the different installations and flexibility of current day networks, 
            the behavior of these networks is constantly changing. Our approach incorporates real-time analysis to account for these 
            dynamic environments.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="bold">Adaptability:</span> Most modern networks have adopted several new technologies to break from 
            previous static environments. Our NIDS is designed with adaptability in mind, capable of evolving with changing network patterns.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 class="italic">Role of Deep Learning</h3>
    <p>
        Deep learning has been at the core of advancements in machine learning in recent years, bringing substantial 
        improvements to intrusion detection systems. Traditional intrusion detection techniques using signatures and 
        rules often suffer with regards to their ability to detect novel attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our approach uses reinforcement learning to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learn from network traffic patterns continuously</li>
        <li>Adapt to new attack vectors without explicit programming</li>
        <li>Reduce false positives through improved pattern recognition</li>
        <li>Enable more effective anomaly detection in complex network environments</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id="architecture">3. System Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        Our NIDS implementation consists of several interconnected modules, each responsible for specific aspects of the 
        intrusion detection process.

    <p>
        This document introduces a hybrid approach to network intrusion detection that overcomes many limitations of traditional systems. 
        By combining reinforcement learning with FPGA hardware acceleration, our NIDS achieves superior performance in terms of 
        detection accuracy, processing speed, and adaptability.
    </p>
    <p>
        The evaluation results highlight the success of the proposed system, which achieved an accuracy of 98.7% in detecting
