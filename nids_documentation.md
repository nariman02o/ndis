## 1. Introduction

The internet has many systems and services, providing convenience and advancement in several domains. However, this advancement comes with security challenges, particularly in detecting and preventing network intrusions. Modern networks face increasingly sophisticated attacks that traditional security measures struggle to detect effectively.

Our Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) addresses these challenges by employing a hybrid approach that combines machine learning techniques with hardware acceleration using PYNQ-Z1 FPGA. This integration enables real-time detection of malicious network activities with higher accuracy and lower latency than software-only solutions.

This document outlines the architecture, implementation details, and performance metrics of our NIDS system, focusing particularly on the integration of FPGA hardware acceleration for enhanced performance.

The primary goals of this project include:
- Develop a real-time network intrusion detection system capable of identifying various attack vectors
- Implement deep packet inspection for thorough traffic analysis
- Utilize reinforcement learning for adaptive threat detection
- Integrate PYNQ-Z1 FPGA hardware acceleration for improved performance
- Create a comprehensive visualization dashboard for network monitoring
- Establish a feedback mechanism for continuous model improvement

### System Overview

Our NIDS employs a multi-layered approach to network security:

## 2. Background

In this section, we delve into the challenges faced by modern NIDS and how our approach helps overcome these limitations.

### Challenges of NIDS

Network Intrusion Detection Systems encounter various challenges that are often overlooked yet significantly impact their effectiveness:

- **Accuracy:** Based on some levels of accuracy, it does not mean that one can rely on existing detection systems. This is why our approach leverages reinforcement learning to continuously improve detection accuracy.
  
- **Diversity:** More than before, there has been a rise in the number of new or customized protocols in modern networks. Our system adapts to this diversity through comprehensive feature extraction and pattern analysis.
  
- **Dynamics:** Because of the different installations and flexibility of current day networks, the behavior of these networks is constantly changing. Our approach incorporates real-time analysis to account for these dynamic environments.
  
- **Adaptability:** Most modern networks have adopted several new technologies to break from previous static environments. Our NIDS is designed with adaptability in mind, capable of evolving with changing network patterns.

### *Role of Deep Learning*

Deep learning has been at the core of advancements in machine learning in recent years, bringing substantial improvements to intrusion detection systems. Traditional intrusion detection techniques using signatures and rules often suffer with regards to their ability to detect novel attacks. 

Our approach uses reinforcement learning to:
- Learn from network traffic patterns continuously
- Adapt to new attack vectors without explicit programming
- Reduce false positives through improved pattern recognition
- Enable more effective anomaly detection in complex network environments

## 3. System Architecture

Our NIDS implementation consists of several interconnected modules, each responsible for specific aspects of the intrusion detection process.
